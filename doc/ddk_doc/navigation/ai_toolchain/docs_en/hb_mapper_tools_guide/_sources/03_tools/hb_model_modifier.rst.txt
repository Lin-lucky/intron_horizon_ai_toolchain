The ``hb_model_modifier`` Tool
===================================

The ``hb_model_modifier`` tool is used for deleting Transpose and Quantize nodes in the input end of specified runtime 
model. Information of the deleted nodes will be saved into the BIN model and can be viewed by the ``hb_model_info`` tool.

.. note::

  1. This tool is used for deleteing the Transpose and Quantize nodes at the input end and deleting the Transpose or  
     Dequantize nodes at the output end. The Transpose node must input/output data directly. 
     The tool can only delete one Transpose or Quantize node at a time.
     When deleting Dequantize node, the Dequantize node and all succeeding nodes will be deleted. 
     Therefore, the operations after Dequantize node will be put into post-processing.
  2. For Transpose and Quantize nodes, all nodes between input node and the to-be-deleted node (if any) 
     are single input/output nodes. For Dequantize node, all nodes between output node and the to-be-deleted node (if any) 
     are single input/output nodes.
  3. This tool cannot process packed models, otherwise it will print: ``ERROR pack model is not supported``.
  4. The Quantize node will convert data type from floating-point into fixed-point. 
     So after deleting it, users will need to convert the data type at model input end into fix-point. 
     The Dequantize node will convert data type from fixed-point into floating-point.
     So after deleting it, users will need to convert the data type at model output end into floating-point and 
     implement post-processing.

How To Use
-----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  hb_model_modifier ${model_file} -r ${node_name}

Parameters
-------------------

.. data:: hb_model_modifier's parameters

  model_file
    This parameter specifies the file name of runtime model.

  -r
    This parameter specifies the name of the to-be-deleted node.

  -o
    This parameter specifies the output name of the modified model (it only becomes valid when the ``-r`` is added)

Parse The Output
----------------------

If there isn't any parameters specified after the command-line, the tool will print candidate nodes to be deleted 
(all transpose, quanti and dequantize nodes in the model). 
The formula to calculate quanti node is: :math:`qx = clamp(round(x / scale) + zero\_point, -128, 127)`, 
wherein the `round(x)` implements floating-point round-off, while the `clamp(x)` function implements clamping data into the integer range between -128 and 127. 
While the formula to calculate dequantize node is: :math:`deqx = (x - zero\_point) * scale`, when deqx is resized back to float or double 
type values and the quanti node is deleted, model input type will be int8; and when the dequantize node is deleted, model 
input type will be either int8 or int32. the `zero_point` refers to the offset value of those `zero_point`s in asymmetric quantization.
While `zero_point = 0` in symmetric quantization.

.. note::

  The tool can support deleting:

  1. quanti or transpose nodes at input part;
  2. dequantize or transpose nodes at output part.
  
  Therefore, users will need to confirm by themselves that the deleted quanti node(s) must be before BPU input; 
  while that the deleted dequantize node(s) must be after BPU input.

Tool printed message is shown as below:

.. code-block:: bash

  hb_model_modifier resnet50_64x56x56_feature.bin
  2021-04-07 11:37:47,035 INFO Nodes that might be deleted: ['data_res2a_branch1_HzQuantize_TransposeInput0', 'data_res2a_branch1_HzQuantize']
  2021-04-07 11:37:47,035 INFO Please make sure node is input node before delete it !!!

When the ``-r`` option is specified, the tool will print model node type and save into the node information in bin file 
and tell users that the specified node has been deleted. As shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

  hb_model_modifier resnet50_64x56x56_feature.bin -r data_res2a_branch1_HzQuantize
  Node 'data_res2a_branch1_HzQuantize' found, its OP type is 'Quantize'
  Node info 'data_res2a_branch1_HzQuantize: [0.13579604029655457]' saved
  Node 'data_res2a_branch1_HzQuantize' is removed
  modified model saved as resnet50_64x56x56_feature_modified.bin

Users can view the information using the ``hb_model_info`` tool:

.. code-block:: bash

  hb_model_info resnet50_64x56x56_feature_modified.bin
  Start hb_model_info....
  hb_model_info version 1.3.15
  ********* resnet50_64x56x56_feature info *********
  ...
  --------- deleted nodes -------------------
