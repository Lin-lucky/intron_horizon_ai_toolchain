The ``vec_diff`` Tool
===========================

The ``vec_diff`` tool is used for helping users find out model accuracy problems. 
Below can be causes of model accuracy problems:

1. There is error in a certain layer caused by either calibration or quantization, 
   the error was somehow enlarged and eventually lead to larger accuracy problem.
#. There is some unknown problem with a certain step during model conversion, during the conversion process, 
   after a few times optimizations and transformations, something might go wrong in these transformations and 
   lead to accuracy problem.
#. Software bug: in those places where numbers are supposed to be the same, error took place due to software bug.

The ``vec_diff`` tool is developed to find out the abovementioned root causes, it can be used to find out 
the output differences of conv layers at different stages.

How To Use
-----------------

The ``vec_diff`` tool can compare the output feature differences at different model conversion stages. 
So, the first step is to obtain the results of the ``hb_mapper infer`` tool.

The ``hb_mapper infer`` tool can be used to obtain model dumped vector files. Please refer to the: 
:ref:`Inference Tool <hb_mapper_infer>` section for tool usage.

Users can obtain the intermediate vector output by running \*.bin model in dev board. 
Please refer to runtime documentations for more information.
