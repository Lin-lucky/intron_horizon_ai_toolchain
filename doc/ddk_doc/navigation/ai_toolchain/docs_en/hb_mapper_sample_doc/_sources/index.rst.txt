Model Convert Sample Doc
==================================

Horizon's **Model Conversion Sample Package (AKA horizon_model_convert_sample)** is composed 
by rich algorithm model sample scripts, it aims to help developers quickly understand how to use the 
model conversion and performance evaluation tools provided by the **ASIC Toolchain**. 
Developers can convert the open source DL frameworks trained FPMs (floating-point model) into the HGM (heterogenous model) 
which can be supported by Horizon's ASICs, deploy models into production.
