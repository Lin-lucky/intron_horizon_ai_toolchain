About DevKits
===================

Horizon Robotics has opened up 3 sets of DevKits: **J3 DVB**, **X3 DVB** and **X3 SDB**.

1. **X3 SDB**, also known as X3 Eco-board or X3 Small Dev Board, is by far the most widely delivered dev board among Horizon's 
   developer users. It is created based on X3M host controller chip, with 5 TOPS AI compute, it can support multi-channel camera input. 
   SDB comes with a motherboard and a core-board (X3 SOM). They are connected by the DIMM slot and has fool-proof design. 
   The installation method is similar with a notebook memory: insert the core-board into DIMM slot at 45 degree angle, 
   then press to lock. See below schematic diagram:

1. **X3 DVB**, also known as X3 Platform Dev Board or X3 Mega Board, is no longer in supply. 
   So if you are a X3 Mega Board user, willing to exchange it into **X3 SDB**, 
   please contact Horizon Robotics's sales or technical personnel.
2. **J3 DVB**, also known as J3 Platform Dev Board or J3 Mega Board, is the standard J3 dev board opens to public. 
   It is created based on J3 host controller chip, with 5 TOPS AI compute, it can support multi-channel camera input.

.. warning::
   From a development perspective, X3 and J3 are basically the same except for differences in SoC performance specifications. 
   Thus, in many scenarios, we offer X3 SDB to customers, execute SoC evaluations or software development based on it.
   
   If you're intended to productize your succeeding projects based on J3, 
   please contact our sales personnel to obtain J3 DVB for development.

   In addition, from an universality perspective, the power consumption control of X3 SDB is not very strict. 
   If you need to evalute SoC power consumption, please contact Horizon's technical personnel for customized 
   power consumption evaluation plan.
