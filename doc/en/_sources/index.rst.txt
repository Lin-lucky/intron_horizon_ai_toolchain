Horizon X3/J3 SOC Development Manual
===============================================

Sunrise3 (X3) and Journey3 (J3) AI processors are power-efficient and high-performance system-on-chip (SOC) rolled out 
by Horizon Robotics in 2020. The Sunrise series are tailored for AIoT; while the Journey series are made for autonomous 
driving domain. Wherein, X3 AI processors can be divided into X3M and X3E versions according to different application 
scenarios.

In terms of compute capacity, both X3M and J3 come with in-built Quad-core Cortex A53 CPU and Dual-core BPU 
(Brain Processing Unit) AI accelerators. Wherein, the Bernoulli 2.0 micro architecture based BPU accelerator can 
provide 5TOPS AI compute.

.. note::
    
    BPU is Horizon's own-developed AI accelerator that can satisfy AIoT/Auto scenario requirements by design. 
    The hardware-software joint optimizations in algorithm, computing architecture and compiler raise AI compute 
    performance by multiple times without increase in power consumption.

    The dual-core Bernoulli-architecture v2 BPU in X3 and J3 AI processors can dramatically boost CNN network support, 
    effectively reduce DDR bandwidth usage and can support real-time pixel level video segmentation and structured video 
    analysis etc. capacities.

In terms of image processing capacities, the 12M in-built Pixels ISP allows X3 and J3 to obtain high-quality images in 
wide dynamic range and low-light conditions. Meanwhile, X3 and J3 come with rich image processing acceleration modules e.g. 
in-built 3D Noise Reduction (3DNR), Lens Distortion Correction (LDC), Geometric Distortion Correction (GDC), image rotation, 
resizing, pyramid, H.265/H.264/MJPEG video encoding/decoding etc. With 4K\@60pfs peak compute, they can also support 4~8 lane 
synchronous processing of camera sensor input in various resolutions. 

In addition, X3 and J3 each comes with one integrated DDR4/LPDDR4/LPDDR4X DDE controller, one USB3.0 host/device module, 
one Gigabit Ethernet MAC with RMII/RGMII interface, bypass video/display output interface, I2S audio port etc. and 
can thus satisfy requirements in different application scenarios.

Lastly but most significantly, to unleash X3 and J3's AI capacities to the full, Horizon provides users with a full set of 
dev board kits, AI development platform and customized industrial solutions. You are about to find out more in later chapters.
