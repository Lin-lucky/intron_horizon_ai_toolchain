###AI Benchmark

Horizon's AI Benchmark Sample Package (hereafter referred to as the ABP) contains the most frequently used
performance and accuracy evaluation samples of classification, detection and segmentation models.
In model performance evaluation samples, developers are able, not only to evaluate the single frame latency,
but also to evaluate the dual-core latency using multi-thread scheduling.
The prebuild source code, executable programs and evaluation scripts in the ABP allow developers
to experience the samples, develop their own applications and make development easier.

The code directory contains source code of an evaluation program developed based on Horizon Robotics' XStream
framework. This application program is used for evaluating model accuracy and performance.


The xj3/j5 directory contains various precompiled application programs and evaluation scripts used for evaluating the
accuracy and performance of different models in Horizon's BPU (Brain Processing Unit).


The build_*.sh script is an one-click real machine compilation script.
